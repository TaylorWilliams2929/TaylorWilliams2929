First, I'd like to thank you for taking a moment to read this breif About Me. 
So, thank you!

My name is Taylor Williams a fledgling software developer out of Columbus, Ohio. 
My background is government campaign work and cocktail bartending. How does that turn into coding? Great question.
There's merit in being a rennesaince man. I hope. 
I've tried various things throughout my time in this city - having graduated college and moved here from Akron, Ohio almost a decade ago.
Though now I think I've entered a pretty cool era in my life. I've been fortunate enough to have been able to step back from the typical rat race and grind to find my focus. I'm excited to put skills from various places together, from technical to soft skills. Basically this is me rambling about how I'm on a mission to grow and strengthen myself as a person in regards to self and to work. 
And if you've read this far cheers!
